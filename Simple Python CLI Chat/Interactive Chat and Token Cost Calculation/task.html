<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>In this stage, you will enhance your CLI-based assistant by enabling it to accept user input from the console, send it to the GPT API, and display the assistant's response. Additionally, you will calculate and display the total token cost associated with each interaction.</p><p>Your first task in this stage is to prompt the user for input using the console. Display a message saying "Enter a message:" to guide the user. Capture their input and prepare it to be sent to the GPT API.</p><p>Next, send the user's input as a message to the GPT API. This will prompt the assistant to generate a response based on the user's input.</p><p>Once the assistant's response is received, display it on the console. Precede the response with <code class="java">"Assistant:"</code> to clearly distinguish between the user's input and the assistant's response. Also, output the user's message in this format: <code class="java">"You:"</code> before assistant's response.</p><p>As an added feature, calculate the total token cost of each interaction. This includes both the input (user's message) and output (assistant's response) costs. Display this cost on the console following each interaction, formatted as <code class="java">"Cost: $..."</code>.</p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Refer to the example for the output format.</p></div><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><p>In this stage, you should:</p><ol><li><p>Prompt the user for input with "Enter a message:" and capture their input.</p></li><li><p>Send the user's input to the GPT API.</p></li><li><p>Display the assistant's response on the console, preceded by "Assistant:".</p></li><li><p>Calculate and display the total token cost of each interaction, formatted as "Cost: $...".</p></li></ol><h5 id="examples">Examples</h5><p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input.
