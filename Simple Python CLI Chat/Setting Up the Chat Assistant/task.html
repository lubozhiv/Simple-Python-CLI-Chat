<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>In this initial stage, you will be laying the foundation for your CLI-based chat assistant. This involves integrating the OpenAI Chat Completions API into a Python program and initiating a basic conversation with your assistant.</p><p>Your first task is to initialize the Chat Completions API provided by OpenAI. This API is the backbone of your assistant, enabling it to generate human-like text based on the prompts it receives. You will need to install the OpenAI Python library, import the necessary modules, and use your OpenAI API key to authenticate your program and create a chat completion session. Don't forget to store your key as an environment variable for security.</p><div class="alert alert-danger"><p><strong>Important Note:</strong><br/>⚠️ This project involves the use of <strong>private keys (OpenAI API keys)</strong> and <code class="java">.env</code> files. Please ensure you <strong>DO NOT expose your keys</strong> by hardcoding them directly into the solution. Instead, always reference them securely from your <code class="java">.env</code> file. Additionally, <strong>do not include your </strong><code class="java">.env</code> file in your project submission. Double-check your code for any <strong>accidental key exposure</strong> before submission. If sharing code snippets, <strong>mask sensitive values</strong>.</p></div><p>Once you've initialized the API, you're ready to start a conversation with your assistant. Begin with a system message to set the behavior of the assistant. A system message might instruct the assistant about its role or provide a context for the conversation.</p><p>Something like this could work to get different responses:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">"You are an helpful assistant for a simple CLI chat. Only respond with text messages. Get creative with the answers!"</code></pre><p>Next, send a user message asking "What are you?" to the assistant. This is a simple prompt that will get the conversation rolling and allow you to test the assistant's ability to generate a meaningful response.</p><p>Finally, output the assistant's response to your console. You can check the example to see the format of the output.</p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><p>In this stage, you should:</p><ol><li><p>Initialize the OpenAI Chat Completions API in a Python program.</p></li><li><p>Create a chat completion session.</p></li><li><p>Start a conversation with a system message.</p></li><li><p>Send a user message asking "What are you?" to the assistant.</p></li><li><p>Output the assistant's response to your console.</p></li></ol><h5 id="examples">Examples</h5><p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input.
